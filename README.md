## What is this?
Just a fun side project I made out of a lack of usb keys, this programe can transfer files over a network with an ecrypted protocole, using LZ4 compression for it's speed.

## DISCLAMER
Do NOT trust the encryption protocols, they are poorly implemented at best and I have no significant experience with it. This repository is more a proof of concept than anything else.
